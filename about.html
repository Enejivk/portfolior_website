                    Hey there, I'm Eneji Victor, and I'm really passionate about web development. This passion led me to enroll in ALX School of Software Engineering. I've been into programming for as
                    long as I can remember. It all began when I was a kid sneaking my mom's phone to connect to the internet. Since then, I've been consuming online content like there's no tomorrow.
                    Eventually, I decided to dive into creating my own products and websites, which paved my path into software engineering. I started my journey with C programming, which was quite
                    challenging, but my passion kept me pushing forward. Over time, I discovered that learning other programming languages became easier. For instance, after mastering Python, it only
                    took me three days to grasp JavaScript! From then on, I've been continuously expanding my knowledge by learning various things online, such as CSS/HTML, JavaScript, Python, SQL,
                    and other frameworks like Flask (a Python framework), Nginx (a web server), and Bash (a command line interface for Linux).
